# BankProblem

This is a complex Artificial Intelligence program that determines wehther a person is qualified for a bank loan based on a data set.

-It does this based training the neural network which is a network of numbers whose values increase and decrease based on a formula and the data set inputed into that forumla.

-It then creates a seperate file for this training data. Before doing this it scales the data

- I then set the parameters for the neural network. I set a value for the number of time the data is trained to further fine tune the network. I set the number of middle nodes. The rate which is used in calucating the weights of the neural network.  

-I then train the data using forward and back calucation method which uses formulas for the weights are changed in the neural network

-I then have a seperate set of data called test data which is teh actual data the predicts the output of each person based on the predictions of the neural network which says whether the invidual is a good,okay, or bad idea to give a loan to. 


It figures this out using a neural network
